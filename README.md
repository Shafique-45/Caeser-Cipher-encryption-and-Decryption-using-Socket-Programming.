# Caeser-Cipher-encryption-and-Decryption-using-Socket-Programming.
This project implements Caesar cipher encryption and decryption using client-server architecture in C. The server sends a plain text message from a file to the client, the client performs encryption or decryption using a user-provided key, and the result is sent back to the server and saved to a file.
